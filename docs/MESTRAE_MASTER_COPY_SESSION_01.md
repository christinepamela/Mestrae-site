## 📝 SESSION TRACKING

### Session 1 - February 4, 2026
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**What We Decided:**
- Launch date: November 1, 2026
- Focus: Mestrae only (not Rangkai/Tiga)
- Strategy: CORE → CONVERSION → DELIGHT
- Start with existing 2D images, add 3D later
- International shipping from day 1
- File structure organized
- Work on weekends, task-based (not time-tracked)

**Questions Answered:**
- ✅ Product count (5 shoes, 20+ heels)
- ✅ Pricing ($120-250 vegan, $400+ leather)
- ✅ Shipping (international, US is largest market)
- ✅ 3D models (will test TRELLIS)
- ✅ Time availability (weekends)
- ✅ Keep existing GitHub repo and build on it
- ✅ Has VS Code, Node.js, Git already installed
- ✅ Local folders created at C:\Users\chris\mestrae

**What We Did:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive master plan (simplified to one doc)
- ✅ Analyzed current website
- ✅ Updated index.html with clearer "Shop Not Open Yet" banner
- ✅ Banner changed to gold color, more prominent message
- ✅ Decided to keep GitHub repo as-is for now

**Decisions Made:**
- One master document (not scattered files)
- Keep current website files, build alongside them
- Organize GitHub structure later (not now)
- Banner: Gold with "⚠️ SHOP NOT OPEN YET — Launching November 2026"

**Next Steps:**
- Upload new index.html to GitHub
- Test that banner shows correctly on live site
- Session 2: Plan website structure (what pages we need)

**Learnings:**
- Keep it simple, avoid overcomplication
- One master document is better than many scattered files
- Start small, learn as we go
- Don't reorganize old files yet - focus on building new
- Clear communication is key (banner had to be obvious)
